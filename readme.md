# Raphael Bar Chart Component Demo

[Live demo](https://raphael-barchart.herokuapp.com/)

### Technologies used
* I've not used any MV* framework because it would generate huge redundancy.
* Used the ES6 features
* Designed with the TypeScript
* Module loader used to isolate code from the global scope
* The Gulp used to automation
* There is still a lot of upgrades to do but lack of time...
* Colors, paddings etc. can be setup by a second, optional constructor's parameter.

### Installation
* `npm i`
* `gulp`
